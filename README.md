# react-native-goal-list

## As we are about to enter the new year, I wanted to have an application where we can write down our goals. At the same time, I wanted to share the first application in the learning phase of React Native 🎄.


Steps to start the project <br/>

<ul>
  <li><code>npm i</code></li>
  <li><code>npm start</code></li>
</ul>

### 👀 If you have "Expo Go" app you can view the project on your phone by scanning the qr code at terminal. 🤳🏼
